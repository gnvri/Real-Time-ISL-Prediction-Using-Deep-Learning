# Real-Time-ISL-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
Real-time Indian Sign Language recognition model by integrating the concept of 2D Convolutional Neural Networks.

Sign Language is a non-verbal type of correspondence used to transfer information unlike speech i.e.,the verbal type of correspondence that utilizes oral articulations through gestures. This project aims to bridge the communication barrier between individuals with speech and hearing disabilityand non-sign language speakers by creating a recognition model using real time motion analysis where the preprocessing of the dataset is performed using Open CV and the images are simultaneously converted to grey image. Subsequently, HSV conversion is applied along with skin masking and Canny-edge detection applied for hand tracking and detection. Sign language prediction is performed with the help of a 2-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, used mainly in image processing applications with the result being translated and stored into a database such that the signed gesture is recognized and translated to text. The overall accuracy achieved via classification through 2-D convolutional neural network, where 33 labels are detected successfully out of 36 labels is 91%.
